The correct statements are:

For TCP:
- It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely.
- The TCP worker might ask: "Have you received boxes x, y, z?" (It ensures data reliability through acknowledgments.)

For UDP:
- It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might lose data along the process.
- UDP does not involve acknowledgment or error checking like TCP, hence the comparison to a "fast but potentially lossy" delivery system.
